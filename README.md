data_fellator.js
================

A tool for extracting "your" data from a social networking site.

When a social networking site stores data on your behalf it
provides some degree of exclusive access to your "identity".
By means of furnishing authentication as the agent for/owner
of that identity a querying entity may obtain data not generally
accessible to unauthenticated actors.

This tool seeks to acquire _all_ data that an authenticated 
identity has special rights to.

The inspiring use case is:  "Downloading all of 'my' data
from Facebook."

The software is compromised entirely of vapor-ware as of this
writing.

This project is covered by the Do What The Fuck You Want Public
Licnse (www.wtfpl.net).
